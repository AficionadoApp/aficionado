Aficionado
==========

Description
-----------
An open-source platform for users to learn more about works at museums and engage in meaningful dialogue about the art. Aficionado also allows institutions and researchers to better gauge visitor interests and crowdsource a great deal of information about their digital images, including meaningful tagging of the content, colors, and genres of their images.

Inspiration
-----------
Ancient Chinese travelers used to make rubbings on paper of [inscriptions](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/EAL/stone/rubbings.html) from important monuments and landmarks.
It was a way to bring back home a concrete piece of the ephemeral experience of their travel. 

Chinese poets extended this practice by writing poetry in the moment when they traveled to especially beautiful locales. A poet would often allude to the [poems of master poets](https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/r/mountain_inscription_rubbing.aspx) who came before and had written about the same location.
